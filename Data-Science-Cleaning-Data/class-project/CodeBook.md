tidydata.txt is a calculated summary of the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset, version 1.0, found at:

https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

The following variables can be found in tidydata.txt.  Each value for each measurement variable in the table is the average of all the measurements in the study for that particular subject and activity.

FFT stands for "Fast Fourier Transform".

subject - The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. 

activity - Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist.
